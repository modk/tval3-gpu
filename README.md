tval3-gpu
=========

These are GPU optimized versions of the TVAL3 algorithm as described in


**GPU-based iterative transmission reconstruction in 3D ultrasound computer
tomography**, [doi:10.1016/j.jpdc.2013.09.007](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpdc.2013.09.007), *Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing*, Volume 74, Issue 1, January 2014, Pages 1730â€“1743.

The original TVAL3 algorithm by Li, Yin, and Zhang as well as accompanying theses by Chengbo Li can be found [here](http://www.caam.rice.edu/~optimization/L1/TVAL3/).

Currently the code here is only provided for reference and it is not
possible to build it. Hopefully I shall upload a more complete version soon.
